## Welcome to CADUS Life Sensor

Life Sensor is a project currently under development at the CADUS Crisis Response Makerspace. It is an assambley kit not suited for medical use.

The project started in April 2017 under name remoÂ²hbo (repairable patient monitoring in mobile hospital boxes). Initially, it was a coorporation of CADUS and the Universities of Applied Sciences HTW-Berlin and Beuth Hochschule, and funded by IFAF Berlin. After the initial research phase, the project is now taken care of by a diverse community, contributing directly in Berlin and remotely likewise.
